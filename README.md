# Wheather-Updates
In this project I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends to local to overall global temperature trends. I had to first get the dataset with simple SQL queries and store them as csv files. After importing the files in pandas data frames I did some basic investigations like linecharts, rolling averages and linear regressions and wrote down all my observations.
